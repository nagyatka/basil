# basil
basil is a simple and flexible tree data structure for php which also provides wide range of import/export
functionalities. (implementation is based on [nicmart/Tree](https://github.com/nicmart/Tree))

We started the development because different tree implementation had already been existed, however we didn't find such 
an implementation, which can provide wide range of import/export functions and high level tree operations as well.
