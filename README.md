# basil
basil is a basic but flexible tree data structure for php (based on nicmart/Tree implementation) which also provides 
wide range of import/export functionalities.

We started the development because different tree implementation had already been existed, however we didn't find such 
an implementation, which can provide wide range of import/export functions and high level tree operations as well.

Based on the previous need, basil follows the logical structure, which is depicted in the next figure:


Main concept:
1. Basil is able to load different formats in a Tree object.
2. The Tree class wraps all functionality which is provided by nicmart/Tree and it offers other high-level operations.
3. A Tree object can be exported to different formats.

This concept also makes possible to use basil as a converter (see the details). 



## Installation

```bash
$ composer require nagyatka/basil
```
We strongly recommend that use version v1.0.*, to get the last bug fixes!

The currently used version of nicmart/Tree in basil project is ~0.2.
